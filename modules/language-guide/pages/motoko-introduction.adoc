{proglang} is a modern programming language you can use specifically for link:../developers-guide/concepts/what-is-ic{outfilesuffix}#ic-overview[{IC} platform] programs or as a general-purpose language for programs running on other platforms.

== Approachability

{proglang} is a modern language designed to be approachable for programmers who have some basic familiarity with modern object-oriented and/or functional programming idioms in either JavaScript, or another modern programming language, such as Rust, Swift, TypeScript, C#, or Java.

== Asynchronous messaging and type sound execution

{proglang} permits modern programming idioms, including special programming abstractions for distributed applications.
Each application consists of an _actor_ that communicates with other actors _without_ using shared state, but instead by using (asynchronous) message passing.
The actor-based programming abstractions of {proglang} permit human-readable message-passing patterns, and they enforce that each network interaction obeys certain rules and avoids certain common mistakes.

Specifically, {proglang} programs are _type sound_ since {proglang} includes a practical, modern type system that checks each one before it executes. 
The {proglang} type system statically checks that each {proglang} program will execute safely, without internal type errors, on all possible inputs. 
Consequently, entire classes of common programming pitfalls that are common in other languages are ruled out, including null pointer errors, mis-matched argument and result types and many others.

To execute, {proglang} statically compiles to link:about-this-guide{outfilesuffix}#wasm[WebAssembly], a portable binary format that abstracts cleanly over modern computer hardware, and thus permits its execution broadly on the Internet, and the link:../developers-guide/concepts/what-is-ic{outfilesuffix}#ic-overview[{IC}].

[[pitch-actors]]
== Each microservice as an _actor_

{proglang} provides an *actor-based* programming model to developers to express _server behavior_, including that of _micro services_ on the Internet and the link:../developers-guide/concepts/what-is-ic{outfilesuffix}#ic-overview[{IC}].

An actor is similar to an object, but is special in that its isolated state exists _remotely_, and its interactions with the world are _asynchronous_.

All communication with and between actors involves passing messages asynchronously over the network using the Internet Computer's messaging protocol.
An actorâ€™s messages are processed in sequence, so state modifications never cause race conditions.

The underlying computing platform provided by the Internet Computer ensures that each message-based synchronization will reach a close, but in doing so each one may also fail due to the usual reasons that arise in distributed systems, including time out.

[[pitch-async-actors]]
=== Asynchronous actors

Like other _modern_ programming languages, {proglang} permits an ergonomic syntax for _asynchronous_ communication among components.

In the case of {proglang}, each communicating component is an actor.

As an example of _using_ actors, perhaps as an actor ourselves, consider this three-line program:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
let result1 = service1.computeAnswer(params);
let result2 = service2.computeAnswer(params);
finalStep(await result1, await result2)
....

We can summarize the program's behavior with three steps:

. The program makes two requests (lines 1 and 2) to two
distinct services, each implemented internally as an actor (object).

. The program waits for each result to be ready (line 3) using the keyword `await` on each result value.

. The program uses both results in the final step (line 3) by calling the `finalStep` function.

Generally-speaking, the services _interleave_ their executions rather than wait for one another, since doing so reduces overall latency.
However, if we try to reduce latency this way _without_ special language support, such interleaving will quickly sacrifice clarity and simplicity.

Even in cases where there are _no_ interleaving executions (for example, if there were only one call above, not two), the programming abstractions still permit clarity and simplicity, for the same reason.
Namely, they signal to the compiler where to transform the program, freeing the programmer from contorting the program's logic in order to interleave its execution with the underlying system's message-passing loop.

Here, the program uses `await` in line 3 to express that interleaving behavior in a simple fashion, with human-readable syntax that is provided by {proglang}.

In language settings that lack these abstractions, developers would not merely call these two functions directly, but would instead employ very advanced programming patterns, possibly registering developer-provided "`callback functions`" within system-provided "`event handlers`".
Each callback would handle an asynchronous event that arises when an answer is ready.  This kind of systems-level programming is powerful, but very error-prone, since it decomposes a high-level data flow into low-level system events that communicate
through shared state. 
Sometimes this style is necessary, but here it is not.

Our program instead eschews that more cumbersome programming style for this more natural, _direct_ style, where each request resembles an ordinary function call. 
This simpler, stylized programming form has become increasingly popular for expressing practical systems that interact with an _external environment_, as most modern software does today.
However, it requires special compiler and type-system support, as we discuss in more detail below.

[[pitch-async-behavior]]
=== Support for _asynchronous_ behavior

In an _asynchronous_ computing setting, a program and its running environment are permitted to perform _internal computations_ that occur _concurrently_ with one another.

Specifically, asynchronous programs are ones where the program's requests of its environment do not (necessarily) require the program to wait for the environment.
In the meantime, the program is permitted to make internal progress within this environment while it waits, perhaps _actively_. In the example, above, the program makes the second request while still waiting for the first micro service.

Symmetrically, the environment's requests of the program do not (necessarily) require the environment to wait for the program's answer to make external progress around it while it waits for this answer.

We do not show an example of this "`notify`" pattern above, since it uses callbacks (and _higher-order_ functions and control flow) and is thus more complex.

[[pitch-async]]
=== Syntactic forms `async` and `await`

To address the need for clarity and simplicity, {proglang} adopts the increasingly-common program constructs `async` and `await`, which afford the programmer a _structured_ language for describing potentially-complex asynchronous dependency graphs.

The link:language-manual{outfilesuffix}#exp-async[async] syntax introduces futures. A future value
represents a _"`promise`" of a result that will be delivered, asynchronously, sometime in the future_ (not shown in the first example above).
You'll learn more about futures when we introduce actors in link:actors-async{outfilesuffix}[Actors and async data].

Here, we merely use the ones that arise from calling `service1.computeAnswer(params)` and
`service2.computeAnswer(params)`.

The syntax `await` synchronizes on a future, and potentially suspends computation until the future is completed by its producer.
We show two uses of the `await` form in the example above, which await the results of the two services.

When the developer uses these keywords, the compiler transforms the program as necessary, often doing complex transformations to the program's control- and data-flow that would be tedious to perform by hand.
Meanwhile, the type system of {proglang} enforces certain correct usage patterns for these constructs, including that types flowing between consumers and producers always agree, and that the types of data sent among services are permitted to flow there, and do
not (for example) contain link:mutable-state{outfilesuffix}[private mutable state].

[[pitch-types]]
=== Types are static

Like other modern programming languages, {proglang} permits each variable to carry the value of a function, object, or a primitive datum (for example, a string, word, or integer).
Other link:basic-concepts{outfilesuffix}#intro-values[types of values] exist too, including records, tuples, and "`tagged data`" called _variants_.

{proglang} enjoys the formal property of type safety, also known as _type soundness_.
We often summarize this idea with the phrase: link:basic-concepts{outfilesuffix}#intro-type-soundness[Well-typed {proglang} programs don't go wrong], meaning that they do not misuse program constructs by treating them as if they have the wrong type.

For example, each variable in a {proglang} program carries an associated _type_, and this type is known _statically_, before the program executes.
Each use of each variable is checked by the compiler to prevent runtime type errors, including null pointer errors.

In this sense, {proglang} types provide a form of _trusted **compiler-verified** documentation_ in the program source code.

As usual, dynamic testing can check properties that are beyond the reach of the {proglang} type system.
While modern, the {proglang} type system is intentionally _not_ "`advanced`" or exotic in any new ways.
Rather, the type system of {proglang} integrates lessons from modern, but well-understood, link:about-this-guide{outfilesuffix}#modern-types[practical type systems] of today to provide an approachable, yet _mathematically precise_ language for general-purpose, distributed programming.
